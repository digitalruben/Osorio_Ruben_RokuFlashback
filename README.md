## Description
The Flashback app is part of the Roku streaming service. Subscribers can use this app to
access three separate flashback features; movies, television and music. Each of these three
sections are comprised exclusively of entertainment from 1950, 1960, 1970, 1980, and 1990. 

The Website will be developed with HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, MySQL and modular SASS. It will use AJAX to request dynamic content from a database.
